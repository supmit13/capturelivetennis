This script gets the live feeds from itftennis website and stores them on your computer.
It should be run from the command line as follows: python getlivestream.py https://live.itftennis.com/en/live-streams/
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. However, it should run with little or no change on other linux distros.
